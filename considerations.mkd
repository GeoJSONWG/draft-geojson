# Security Considerations

GeoJSON shares security issues common to all JSON content types.  See
[RFC7159] Section 12 for additional information. GeoJSON does not
provide executable content.

As with other geographic data formats, e.g., [KMLv2.2], providing
details about the locations of sensitive persons, animals, habitats, and
facilities can expose them to unauthorized tracking or injury.  GeoJSON
does not provide privacy or integrity services.  If sensitive data requires
privacy or integrity protection, those must be provided by the transport â€” for
example TLS or HTTPS. There will be cases in which stored data need protection,
which is out of scope for this document.

# Interoperability Considerations

## I-JSON

GeoJSON texts should follow the constraints of I-JSON [RFC7493] for
maximum interoperability.

## Coordinate Precision

The size of a GeoJSON text in bytes is a major interoperability
consideration and precision of coordinate values has a large impact on
the size of texts.  A GeoJSON text containing many detailed polygons can
be inflated almost by a factor of two by increasing coordinate precision
from 6 to 15 decimal places. For geographic coordinates with units of
degrees, 6 decimal places (a default common in, e.g., sprintf) amounts
to about 10 centimeters, a precision well within that of current GPS
systems.  Implementations should consider the cost of using a greater
precision than necessary.

Furthermore the WGS 84 [WGS84] datum is a relatively coarse approximation of
the geoid; with the height varying by up to 5m (but generally between 2 and 3
meters) higher or lower relative to a surface parallel to Earth's mean sea
level.
