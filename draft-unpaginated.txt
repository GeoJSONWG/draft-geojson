1.  Introduction

   Geospatial JavaScript Object Notation (GeoJSON) is a format for
   encoding a variety of geographic data structures.  A GeoJSON object
   may represent a geometry, a feature, or a collection of features.

   GeoJSON supports the following seven geometry types:

   o  Point

   o  LineString

   o  Polygon

   o  MultiPoint

   o  MultiLineString

   o  MultiPolygon

   o  GeometryCollection

   Two additional types are comprised by GeoJSON:

   o  Feature

   o  FeatureCollection

   Fetures in GeoJSON contain a geometry object and additional
   properties, and a feature collection represents a list of features.

   A complete GeoJSON data structure is always an object (in JSON
   terms).  In GeoJSON, an object consists of a collection of name/value
   pairs -- also called members.  For each member, the name is always a
   string.  Member values are either a string, number, object, array or
   one of the JSON literals: true, false, and null.  An array consists
   of elements where each element is a value as described above.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The ordering of the members of any JSON object defined in this
   document MUST be considered irrelevant, as specified by [RFC4627].

   The ordering of the elements of any JSON array defined in this
   document MUST at least follow a stable ordering unless the specific
   object's type it is a member of defines an absolute ordering, which
   then takes precedence.

   Some examples use the combination of a JavaScript single line comment
   (//) followed by an ellipsis (...) as placeholder notation for
   content deemed irrelevant by the authors and at that point.  These
   placeholders must of course be deleted or otherwise replaced, before
   attempting to validate the corresponding JSON code example.

   Note-sdrees: The second and third paragraph of this section have been
   added, to not forget to satisfy the need of issueing structural
   constraints with strong impact on interoperability (but not
   necessarily at this place or in this form).

1.2.  Definitions

   o  JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and the terms object, name,
      value, array, number, true, false, and null are to be interpreted
      as defined in [RFC4627].

   o  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http) is defined in [RFC2616].

   o  Transport Layer Security (TLS) is defined in [RFC5246].

   o  Hypertext Transfer Protocol Over TLS (https) is defined in
      [RFC2818].

   o  The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is defined in [RFC3986].

   o  Inside this document the term geometry types refers to the seven
      case-sensitive strings: "Point", "MultiPoint", "LineString",
      "MultiLineString", "Polygon", "MultiPolygon", and
      "GeometryCollection".

   o  As a another shorthand notation the term GeoJSON types refers to
      the nine case-senisitve strings "Feature", "FeatureCollection" and
      those considered geometry types.

   o  A hole is considered - for the sake of illustration - as simply a
      geometric shape, that is to be excluded from the geometric shape
      it appears in.

   o  When using the term interior geometric shape it is assumed, that
      there exists an exterior shape so that the former is fully
      included inside the convex hull of the latter.

   Note-sdrees: The last four items in the list above are added, to not
   forget to satisfy the need of defining these terms (but not
   necessarily at this place or in this form).

   Note-sdrees: We should consider adding at least an optional member on
   the top-level GeoJSON object with name "namespace" and a value of say
   "http://geojson.org/ns/geojson" or maybe something (after acceptance
   by the IETF like "http://docs.ietf.org/ns/rfc9876" hypothetically
   assuming this ends up as RFC9876) but then we might have also to
   adapt the "no action needed from IANA section".  Then we might
   somewhere have a section "Namespace" explaining it in general and
   amend its usage with:

   o  The namespace member SHOULD be on the top-level GeoJSON object in
      the following canonical hierarchical ordering, i.e.  if present on
      a feature collection, else if present on a feature, else on a
      geometry and and MUST NOT be repeated or overridden on children or
      grandchildren of the object.

   Motivation for above proposal: The benefit would be, that we a)
   remain backwards compatible, but b) avoid future clashes with JSON of
   unclear provenience when being consumed by the client.  Alternatively
   one might prefix all wonderful type names with say "geo" and a dot or
   so (not preferred) or even the names of the members (shiver).

1.3.  Example

   A GeoJSON feature collection:

   {
       "type": "FeatureCollection",
       "features": [{
           "type": "Feature",
           "geometry": {
               "type": "Point",
               "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]
           },
           "properties": {
               "prop0": "value0"
           }
       }, {
           "type": "Feature",
           "geometry": {
               "type": "LineString",
               "coordinates": [
                   [102.0, 0.0],
                   [103.0, 1.0],
                   [104.0, 0.0],
                   [105.0, 1.0]
               ]
           },
           "properties": {
               "prop0": "value0",
               "prop1": 0.0
           }
       }, {
           "type": "Feature",
           "geometry": {
               "type": "Polygon",
               "coordinates": [
                   [
                       [100.0, 0.0],
                       [101.0, 0.0],
                       [101.0, 1.0],
                       [100.0, 1.0],
                       [100.0, 0.0]
                   ]
               ]
           },
           "properties": {
               "prop0": "value0",
               "prop1": {
                   "this": "that"
               }
           }
       }]
   }


   Note that unquoted whitespace is not significant in JSON.  Whitespace
   is used in the examples inside this document to help illustrate the
   data structures, but is not required.

2.  GeoJSON Object

   As stated in the introduction, a complete Geospatial JSON (GeoJSON)
   data structure is always represented as a single JSON object that
   represents a geometry, feature, or collection of features and will be
   referred to as the GeoJSON object in this document.

   o  The GeoJSON object MUST have one or more members (name/value
      pairs) including a member with the name "type".  This member's
      value is a case-sensitive string that determines the type of the
      GeoJSON object by being one of GeoJSON types.  If - depending on
      this value - additional rules apply, then these are stated in the
      following sections where each type is further defined.

   o  A GeoJSON object MAY have an optional "crsRef" member.  If it is
      present, the value of it MUST be a valid coordinate reference
      system reference (see "3.  Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
      Reference [1]").

   o  A GeoJSON object MAY have a "bbox" member.  If it is present, the
      value of it MUST be a bounding box array (see "4.  Bounding Box").

2.1.  Geometry Object

   A geometry is a GeoJSON object where the type member's value is a
   geometry type.

   A GeoJSON geometry object of any type other than "GeometryCollection"
   MUST have a member with the name "coordinates".  The value of the
   coordinates member is always an array.  The structure for the
   elements in this array is determined by the type of geometry.

2.1.1.  Position

   A position is the fundamental geometry construct.  The "coordinates"
   member of a geometry object is composed of either:

   o  one position (in the case of a Point geometry),

   o  an array of positions (LineString or MultiPoint geometries),

   o  an array of arrays of positions (Polygons, MultiLineStrings),

   o  or a multidimensional array of positions (MultiPolygon).

   A position is represented by an array of numbers.  There MUST be two
   or more elements.  The order of elements must follow x, y, z order
   that is:

   o  easting, northing, altitude for coordinates in a projected
      coordinate reference system, or

   o  longitude, latitude, altitude for coordinates in a geographic
      coordinate reference system.

   Any number of additional elements are allowed -- interpretation and
   meaning of additional elements is beyond the scope of this
   specification.

   Examples of positions and geometries are provided in "Appendix A.
   Geometry Examples".

2.1.2.  Point

   For type "Point", the "coordinates" member MUST be a single position.

2.1.3.  MultiPoint

   For type "MultiPoint", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
   positions.

2.1.4.  LineString

   For type "LineString", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
   two or more positions.

2.1.5.  MultiLineString

   For type "MultiLineString", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array
   of LineString coordinate arrays.

2.1.6.  Polygon

   To specify a constraint specific to polygons, it is useful to
   introduce the concept of a linear ring (LinearRing):

   o  A LinearRing is a closed LineString with 4 or more positions.

   o  The first and last positions are equivalent (they represent
      equivalent points).

   Though a LinearRing is not explicitly represented as a GeoJSON
   geometry type, it leads to a canonical formulation of the Polygon
   geometry type definition as follows:

   o  For type "Polygon", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
      LinearRing coordinate arrays.

   o  For Polygons with more than one of these rings, the first MUST be
      the exterior ring and any others MUST be interior rings or holes.

2.1.7.  MultiPolygon

   For type "MultiPolygon", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
   Polygon coordinate arrays.

2.1.8.  Geometry Collection

   A GeoJSON object with type "GeometryCollection" is a geometry object
   which represents a collection of geometry objects.

   A geometry collection MUST have a member with the name "geometries".
   The value corresponding to "geometries" is an array.  Each element in
   this array is a GeoJSON geometry object.

2.2.  Feature Object

   A GeoJSON object with the type "Feature" is a feature object.

   o  A feature object MUST have a member with the name "geometry".  The
      value of the geometry member is a geometry object as defined above
      or a JSON null value.

   o  A feature object MUST have a member with the name "properties".
      The value of the properties member is an object (any JSON object
      or a JSON null value).

   o  If a feature has a commonly used identifier, that identifier
      SHOULD be included as a member of the feature object with the name
      "id".

2.3.  Feature Collection Object

   A GeoJSON object with the type "FeatureCollection" is a feature
   collection object.

   An object of type "FeatureCollection" MUST have a member with the
   name "features".  The value corresponding to "features" is an array.
   Each element in the array is a feature object as defined above.

3.  Coordinate Reference System (CRS) Reference

   The coordinate reference system of a GeoJSON object is determined by
   its "crsRef" member (referred to as the CRS reference below).  If an
   object has no crsRef member, then its parent or grandparent object's
   crsRef member may be acquired.  If no crsRef member can be so
   acquired, the default CRS shall apply to the GeoJSON object.

   o  The default CRS is a geographic coordinate reference system, using
      the WGS84 datum, and with longitude and latitude units of decimal
      degrees.  Note-sdrees: FIXME mail from Adrian Custer states as
      *the two GeoJSON crs* CRS84 (an axis-flipped WGS84) and CRSGoogle
      (EPGS:3857).  So is this really WGS84 mentioned as default?

   o  The value of a member named "crsRef" must be a string (referred to
      as the CRS reference below) or JSON null.  If the value of
      "crsRef" is null, no CRS can be assumed.  Note-sdrees: FIXME or
      default CRS as when crsRef member is left out?  It is optional
      anyway.

   o  The crsRef member SHOULD be on the top-level GeoJSON object in the
      following canonical hierarchical ordering, i.e.  if present on a
      feature collection, else if present on a feature, else on a
      geometry and and MUST NOT be repeated or overridden on children or
      grandchildren of the object.

   o  The referenced CRS SHALL NOT change coordinate ordering (see
      "2.1.1 Position").

   Note-sdrees: The name has been changed from crs to crsRef to not
   irritate consumers that expect the crs object as of version 1.0 in
   the community spec.

   Note-sdrees: It might be beneficial to make the crsRef member's value
   an object with exactly two possible exclusive members: "id" xor
   "href" to help the consumer with the semantics of the values content.

3.1.  Named CRS Reference

   A CRS reference MAY indicate a coordinate reference system by name.
   In this case, the value of it MUST be a string identifying a
   coordinate reference system.  OGC CRS URNs such as
   "urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:1.3:CRS84" SHALL be preferred over legacy
   identifiers such as "EPSG:4326":

   "crsRef": "urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:1.3:CRS84"


3.2.  Linked CRS Reference

   A CRS reference may link to CRS parameters on the Web.  In this case,
   its value MUST be a dereferenceable http or https URL and the
   producer of a GeoJSON object SHOULD and is strongly encouraged to
   prefer absolute URLs over relative URLs as value to ease the
   disambiguation from a named CRS reference for the consumer of the
   object.

4.  Bounding Box

   A GeoJSON object MAY have a member named "bbox" to include
   information on the coordinate range for geometries, features, or
   feature collections.  The value of the bbox member MUST be an array
   of length 2*n where n is the number of dimensions represented in the
   contained geometries, with the lowest values for all axes followed by
   the highest values.  The axes order of a bbox follows the axes order
   of geometries.  In addition, the coordinate reference system for the
   bbox is assumed to match the coordinate reference system of the
   GeoJSON object of which it is a member.

   Example of a bbox member on a feature:

   {
       "type": "Feature",
       "bbox": [-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, 90.0],
       "geometry": {
           "type": "Polygon",
           "coordinates": [
               [
                   [-180.0, 10.0],
                   [20.0, 90.0],
                   [180.0, -5.0],
                   [-30.0, -90.0]
               ]
           ]
       }
       //...
   }


   Example of a bbox member on a feature collection:

   {
       "type": "FeatureCollection",
       "bbox": [100.0, 0.0, 105.0, 1.0],
       "features": [
       //...
       ]
   }

Appendix A.  Geometry Examples

   Each of the examples below represents a valid and complete GeoJSON
   object.

A.1.  Point

   Point coordinates are in x, y order (easting, northing for projected
   coordinates, longitude, latitude for geographic coordinates):

   {
       "type": "Point",
       "coordinates": [100.0, 0.0]
   }


A.2.  LineString

   Coordinates of LineString are an array of positions (see "2.1.1.
   Position"):

   {
       "type": "LineString",
       "coordinates": [
           [100.0, 0.0],
           [101.0, 1.0]
       ]
   }


A.3.  Polygon

   Coordinates of a Polygon are an array of LinearRing (cf.  "2.1.6
   Polygon") coordinate arrays.  The first element in the array
   represents the exterior ring.  Any subsequent elements represent
   interior rings (or holes).

   No holes:

   {
       "type": "Polygon",
       "coordinates": [
           [
               [100.0, 0.0],
               [101.0, 0.0],
               [101.0, 1.0],
               [100.0, 1.0],
               [100.0, 0.0]
           ]
       ]
   }


   With holes:

   {
       "type": "Polygon",
       "coordinates": [
           [
               [100.0, 0.0],
               [101.0, 0.0],
               [101.0, 1.0],
               [100.0, 1.0],
               [100.0, 0.0]
           ],
           [
               [100.2, 0.2],
               [100.8, 0.2],
               [100.8, 0.8],
               [100.2, 0.8],
               [100.2, 0.2]
           ]
       ]
   }


A.4.  MultiPoint

   Coordinates of a MultiPoint are an array of positions::

   {
       "type": "MultiPoint",
       "coordinates": [
           [100.0, 0.0],
           [101.0, 1.0]
       ]
   }


A.5.  MultiLineString

   Coordinates of a MultiLineString are an array of LineString
   coordinate arrays:

   {
       "type": "MultiLineString",
       "coordinates": [
           [
               [100.0, 0.0],
               [101.0, 1.0]
           ],
           [
               [102.0, 2.0],
               [103.0, 3.0]
           ]
       ]
   }


A.6.  MultiPolygon

   Coordinates of a MultiPolygon are an array of Polygon coordinate
   arrays:

   {
       "type": "MultiPolygon",
       "coordinates": [
           [
               [
                   [102.0, 2.0],
                   [103.0, 2.0],
                   [103.0, 3.0],
                   [102.0, 3.0],
                   [102.0, 2.0]
               ]
           ],
           [
               [
                   [100.0, 0.0],
                   [101.0, 0.0],
                   [101.0, 1.0],
                   [100.0, 1.0],
                   [100.0, 0.0]
               ],
               [
                   [100.2, 0.2],
                   [100.8, 0.2],
                   [100.8, 0.8],
                   [100.2, 0.8],
                   [100.2, 0.2]
               ]
           ]
       ]
   }


A.7.  GeometryCollection

   Each element in the geometries array of a GeometryCollection is one
   of the geometry objects described above:

   {
       "type": "GeometryCollection",
       "geometries": [{
           "type": "Point",
           "coordinates": [100.0, 0.0]
       }, {
           "type": "LineString",
           "coordinates": [
               [101.0, 0.0],
               [102.0, 1.0]
           ]
       }]
   }
