Some issues are to be resolved, others are not yet known:

* Is the migration from the crs object to a crs reference ok?

* Are the formal changes applied to the existing community spec at `http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html`_ ok?

* Is there consensus, that the mostly editorial changes apllied are also an enhancement or where these have to be reversed or completed?
