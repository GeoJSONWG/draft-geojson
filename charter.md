Charter
=======

Start of an IETF GeoJSON WG charter document.

GeoJSON
-------

GeoJSON is a geospatial data interchange format based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It has succeeded in streamlining geographic information system standards and making them accessible to practitioners of modern web development. GeoJSON today plays an important role in many spatial databases, web APIs, and open data platforms. However, editorial and architectural flaws in its original specification have been and continue to be obstacles for implementers. This working group is charged with the following tasks:

- improving the clarity of the GeoJSON format specification
- addressing points of chronic misunderstanding
- improving interoperability with respect to coordinate reference systems
- removing features that have not been widely implemented or have hindered interoperability
- adding implementation and extension advice.

The working group is not charged with adding new features to the GeoJSON format specification.

The working group plans for one deliverable: a GeoJSON format RFC. The working group will start from draft-butler-geojson-04.
