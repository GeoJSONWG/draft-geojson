Proposed GeoJSON WG Charter
===========================

GeoJSON
-------

GeoJSON is a format for encoding data about geographic features using
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159]. Geographic features need not be
physical things; any thing with qualities that are bounded in space may be
considered a feature. GeoJSON provides a means of representing both the
qualities and spatial extent of features.

The GeoJSON format specification was published at http://geojson.org in 2008.
GeoJSON today plays an important role in many spatial databases, web APIs, and
open data platforms.

This WG will work on a GeoJSON Format RFC that specifies the format more
precisely, serves as a better guide for implementers, and improves
extensibility of the format. The work will start from an Internet-Draft written
by the original authors:
[draft-butler-geojson](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-butler-geojson).

This WG will work on a format for a streamable sequence of GeoJSON texts based
on RFC 7464.

This WG will work on GeoJSON mappings of 'geo' URIs, reinforcing the use of
RFC 5870.
