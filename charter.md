Proposed GeoJSON WG Charter
===========================

GeoJSON
-------

GeoJSON is a geospatial data interchange format based on JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON). It was published at http://geojson.org in 2008. It has
succeeded in streamlining geographic information system standards and making
them accessible to practitioners of modern web development. GeoJSON today plays
an important role in many spatial databases, web APIs, and open data platforms.

This WG will work on a GeoJSON Format RFC that specifies the format more
precisely and serves as a better guide for implementers. The work will start
from an Internet-Draft written by the original authors. This I-D,
[draft-butler-geojson-04](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-butler-geojson-04),
substantially improves the format specification. The remaining tasks of the WG
are:

- Further clarification of the GeoJSON format specification.
- Addition of implementation advice based on lessons learned since 2008.
- Addition of more explicit extension advice to the specification.

The addition of new features to the GeoJSON format is not within the scope of
this WG. One possible exception to this (depending on WG consensus) is the
adoption of JSON Text Sequences as an alternative way of serializing sets of
GeoJSON objects.
